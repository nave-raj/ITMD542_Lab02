## Project Description
This project is a Node.js Express application that acts as a contact database. It allows users to create, edit, view, and delete individual contacts. The home page lists all contacts, and from there, users can perform various operations on each contact. The application persists contact data using a JSON file on the file system.

* Run npm run dev to start the application.
* Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the home page of the application.

## Insights and Results
During the development of this project, I gained a better understanding of Node.js and Express framework and learned how to use CRUD operations along with working with the file systems. 
One of the challenges I faced was ensuring proper validation and sanitization of user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
